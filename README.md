# How-long-is-the-recovery-period-after-robotic-cancer-surgery-
Most patients recover faster after robotic surgery than open surgery. Many can go home within 2–3 days, and start doing light activities in a week. Full recovery usually takes 2–4 weeks, depending on how big the surgery was. For bigger cancers, the healing may take longer. Pain is usually less, and fewer stitches means less chance of infection. But still, patient should rest, eat well, and follow doctor’s advice after surgery. Returning to work or travel also depends on individual health and type of operation.
